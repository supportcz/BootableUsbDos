                         ÿþçQEMM and Microsoft Windows

  QEMM is fully compatible with Microsoft Windows 3.1 through
  Windows 95. QEMM automatically provides more memory for 
  running  Windows or DOS programs inside Windows 386 enhanced 
  mode or Windows 95. Also, you can use QEMM's VIDRAM feature to 
  extend  the amount of memory available to DOS text-based programs
  running in Windows 3.1 by up to 96K (see the QEMM User Guide).

  QEMM 9 includes features for Windows; FreeMeg makes sure that
  Windows programs don't gobble conventional memory that could be
  useful to other programs.  Resource Manager allows you to open
  more programs, and MagnaRAM multiplies your Windows memory.
  These features can be enabled with the Windows version of
  QSETUP.  
               ÿþçQEMM and DESQview or DESQview/X

  If you are using DESQview or DESQview/X, you can increase the 
  amount of memory in each window by using the Stealth ROM 
  feature. To find out if you are using Stealth ROM, select "Review 
  or change QEMM parameters" from the main QEMM Setup menu. 
  Then look for the selection "Stealth system and video ROMs." If 
  you see the word "Mapping" or "Frame" at the end of that line, 
  Stealth ROM is already enabled. If you see the word "Off," you
  can enable Stealth ROM by typing "S" or hitting the ENTER key,
  then following the on-screen instructions.  Online Help will tell
  you more about the Mapping and Frame methods of Stealth ROM.
    
  If you have DOS version 5 or 6, QEMM's installation places the 
  command DOS=HIGH in your CONFIG.SYS file (if it is not already  
             ÿþçQEMM and DESQview or DESQview/X (Continued)

  there). This is a DOS command that loads part of DOS and DOS 
  BUFFERS into the HMA (the first 64K of memory above 1MB). 

  You may be able to increase the amount of memory in DESQview or 
  DESQview/X windows by deleting DOS=HIGH from CONFIG.SYS. 
  To find  out, first run Memory Status from inside DESQview or 
  DESQview/X.  Make a note of the figure in the bottom right under 
  "Largest Available Expanded Memory."  Then delete DOS=HIGH 
  from your CONFIG.SYS and run Optimize by typing OPTIMIZE at 
  the DOS prompt. When Optimize completes, run Memory Status from 
  inside DESQview  or DESQview/X and check "Largest Available 
  Expanded Memory"  again.  If it is a larger number than before, 
  you are better off without DOS=HIGH. Otherwise, add the line 
             ÿþçQEMM and DESQview or DESQview/X (Continued)
 
  the line DOS=HIGH back to CONFIG.SYS and re-run Optimize.

  For more suggestions on increasing the size of your DESQview or
  DESQview/X windows, see Chapter 11 of the QEMM Online
  Technical Reference. For information on using the technical 
  reference see Appendix D of the QEMM 97 User Guide.
                ÿþç QEMM and Disk Compression Software
                    ÿþç(e.g., Stacker, DriveSpace)

  QEMM is fully compatible with current disk compression software,
  and includes special features for Stacker and MS-DOS's DoubleSpace 
  and DriveSpace. QEMM's Stealth D*Space feature reduces the 
  memory overhead of DoubleSpace or DriveSpace in MS-DOS 6  to 
  as  little as 3K. If you are using MS-DOS disk compression, this 
  feature will be displayed on the QSETUP main menu; choose 
  "Enable or disable Stealth D*Space," then Yes to enable the 
  feature.  Stealth D*Space does not provide benefits under 
  MS-DOS version 7.

  Adding the /QD parameter to the STACKER.INI file can reduce
  Stacker's overhead to as little as 10K. 
      ÿþçUsing QEMM with Disk Compression Software (Continued)
  
  If you are using older disk compression software, you may need to
  take special steps to use QEMM.  For more information on QEMM
  and Stacker, see Chapter 16 of the QEMM online Technical 
  Reference. For information on using the technical reference, 
  see Appendix D of the QEMM 97 User Guide.

   ÿþèStackerÿþæ - If you have Stacker versions from 2.01 through 4.0, 
  no special steps are generally required; however, we do suggest 
  you read the Stacker chapter before running Optimize.  
    ÿþçUsing QEMM with Disk Compression Software (Continued)

  ÿþèDoubleSpace or DriveSpaceÿþæ - If you are using MS-DOS 6's
  DoubleSpace or DriveSpace, you can save 31K-49K of memory by
  using QEMM's Stealth D*Space feature to relocate the DoubleSpace
  or DriveSpace device driver in expanded memory.  See Chapter 5 of
  the QEMM Manual for details.
                ÿþçQEMM and Bus-Mastering Devices

  Certain SCSI disk controller cards (and, less frequently, ESDI
  disk controllers and network cards) use a technique called
  bus-mastering to speed up disk access. This technique can cause a
  conflict when memory managers attempt to load a device driver or
  TSR into upper memory.

  QEMM automatically supports bus-mastering disk controllers. In most
  cases, QEMM can detect a bus-mastering hard disk controller and
  will take steps to prevent problems. (This is not true if the card
  controls something other than a hard drive or if QEMM is not being
  loaded from the bus-mastering hard drive.)
             ÿþçQEMM and Bus-Mastering Devices (Continued)

  For more information on QEMM and bus-mastering devices, see 
  Chapter 12 of the QEMM Online Technical Reference.For instructions 
  on using the technical reference, see Appendix D of the QEMM 97 
  User Guide.
                   ÿþçQEMM and the EMS Page Frame
  Most programs that use expanded memory (EMS) access up to 64K of
  expanded memory at a time (in 16K units called pages) at a special
  area of upper memory called the page frame. An expanded memory
  manager (QEMM) makes memory from outside the first megabyte of
  memory appear in the page frame.

  QEMM's installation normally reserves 64K of upper memory for use
  as a page frame. You can use QSETUP to specify that no page frame
  should be used; however, we strongly recommend that you do NOT do
  this. See Chapter 17 of the QEMM Online Technical Reference. 
  For instructions on using the technical reference, see Appendix D 
  of the QEMM 97 User Guide.
                 ÿþçQEMM's Stealth ROM Feature

  Stealth ROM is an exclusive QEMM feature that can typically create
  an additional 48K to 115K of High RAM on almost any PC. Stealth
  ROM hides your PC's ROMs and makes their memory addresses
  available for High RAM or expanded memory mapping. The 
  advantage of having the additional High RAM is that QEMM can 
  load TSRs, device drivers and selected parts of DOS there instead 
  of in conventional memory. By freeing up conventional memory, 
  you will  have more room for running DOS programs.

  Depending on your configuration and the installation options you
  chose, Stealth ROM may have been enabled on your system when you
  installed QEMM. When you run the Optimize program, Optimize will
                ÿþçQEMM's Stealth ROM Feature (Continued)

  try to load your TSRs, device drivers and selected parts of DOS
  into High RAM. If all of them will not fit, Optimize will test
  your system for compatibility with Stealth ROM and will determine
  which Stealth ROM method is best for your system.
 
  For more information on Stealth ROM, see Chapter 3 of the QEMM 
  Online Technical Reference. For instructions on using the 
  technical reference, see Appendix D of the QEMM 97 User Guide.
                     ÿþçQEMM's Optimize Program

  Optimize is a program that determines how to load TSRs, device 
  drivers and selected parts of DOS into upper memory. Optimize 
  analyzes the memory requirements of device drivers and TSRs that 
  you are loading from CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT and any 
  batch files called by AUTOEXEC.BAT. Then, Optimize determines the 
  most efficient way to load items into High RAM by testing all 
  possible  locations.  There can be millions of  possibilities.

  The object is to free up as much conventional memory as possible 
  for your DOS programs. If you are using QEMM's DOS-Up feature, 
  Optimize also experiments with different ways of loading parts 
  of DOS into upper memory.  
                ÿþçQEMM's Optimize Program (Continued)

  When you install QEMM, INSTALL offers to run Optimize. You 
  should  run Optimize again if you add new hardware devices or 
  modify your AUTOEXEC.BAT or CONFIG.SYS files.

  Optimize must reboot your machine two or more times to complete 
  its testing. Optimize changes the lines that load device drivers 
  and TSRs by adding a LOADHI command to the beginning of those 
  lines. For example, a device driver line that looks like this:
      
      ÿþèDEVICE=C:\DOS\SETVER.EXE
  
  would look something like this after Optimize has done its work:  
                 ÿþçQEMM's Optimize Program (Continued)

      ÿþèDEVICE=C:\QEMM\LOADHI.SYS /R:1 C:\DOS\SETVER.EXE

  A TSR line in AUTOEXEC.BAT that looks like this: 
      
      ÿþèC:\DOS\SMARTDRV.EXE

  would look something like this after running Optimize:

      ÿþèC:\QEMM\LOADHI /R:2 C:\DOS\SMARTDRV.EXE

  For detailed information on Optimize, see Chapter 3 of the 
  QEMM Manual. For information on the LOADHI command, see
  Chapter 7 of the QEMM Online Technical Reference. For 
  instructions on using the technical  reference, see Appendix D 
  of the QEMM 97 User Guide.
                     ÿþçUndoing an Optimize

  When you run QEMM's Optimize program, modifications are made to
  your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files and any batch file 
  called by AUTOEXEC.BAT. If for some reason you want to restore 
  these files to their pre-optimized states, type UNOPT at the DOS
  prompt. The files will be restored to the state they were in
  before you last ran Optimize.

  To see a list of the nine most recent configurations that have
  been modified by QEMM programs, type OPTIMIZE /RESTORE at 
  the DOS prompt. You can then select the configuration you would 
  like Optimize to restore. In addition to the nine most recent
  configurations, the list contains the configuration that existed
  at the time you installed QEMM.  
                      ÿþçThe Manifest Program

  Manifest is a powerful system reporting program that is
  automatically installed on your hard drive when you install QEMM.
  While Manifest can be extremely useful when troubleshooting a
  problem, it is much more than a diagnostic tool.  Whether you are
  new to computers or a power user with years of DOS experience
  under your belt, Manifest will help you take full advantage of the
  memory that is installed in your computer.

  To run Manifest, just type MFT at the DOS prompt.  At your own
  pace explore the world of memory as it relates to your own PC.
  Press F1 anytime for context-sensitive online help.
            ÿþçVIDRAM - Extending Memory for Text-based Programs

  QEMM's VIDRAM program can extend conventional memory by as 
  much as 96K for running DOS text-based programs. VIDRAM even 
  extends conventional memory for DOS text programs running in 
  Microsoft  Windows. 

  To use VIDRAM, your system must have an EGA or VGA video 
  adapter  or an adapter with EGA or VGA capability (this includes
  VGA-compatible 8514A video adapters).  Your PC must have 
  640K of  conventional memory and the programs that you run 
  while using  VIDRAM must not use EGA or VGA graphics.  
   ÿþçVIDRAM - Extending Memory for Text-based Programs (Continued)
 
  If your PC has an EGA or VGA video adapter, the 64K memory area 
  just above conventional memory (640K-704K or A000-AFFF hex) is 
  reserved for use by graphics modes. When you run text-based 
  programs, that area is unused, so VIDRAM can appropriate it to 
  extend the contiguous conventional memory for running programs.

  It is important to understand that you cannot run EGA or VGA 
  graphics operations while VIDRAM is in use. If you routinely use 
  both large text-based programs and graphics programs, you can 
  turn the VIDRAM feature on when you need it for a text program 
  and off before you run a graphics program. If you are using an 
  8514A adapter, you can still use 8514 graphics programs while 
  VIDRAM is enabled.  
   ÿþçVIDRAM - Extending Memory for Text-based Programs (Continued)

  To turn VIDRAM on type VIDRAM ON at the DOS prompt.
  This command will extend conventional memory into the EGA/VGA
  graphics area for a total of 704K conventional memory.

  To turn VIDRAM off so you can use graphics programs again, type
  VIDRAM OFF. 

  For more information on VIDRAM, including using VIDRAM with
  Microsoft Windows, DESQview, and DESQview/X, and extending
  conventional memory an additional 32K, see Chapter 4 of the QEMM 
  Online Technical Reference. For instructions on using the 
  technical  reference, see Appendix D of the QEMM 97 User Guide.
           ÿþçTips on Freeing Up More Conventional Memory

  If you use DOS text-based programs, you can extend conventional 
  memory by as much as 96K by using QEMM's VIDRAM feature.  For 
  information on VIDRAM, see Chapter 4 of the QEMM 
  Online Technical Reference. For instructions on using the 
  technical reference, see Appendix D of the QEMM 97 User Guide.
 
  The Manifest program may be able to tell you how to free up 
  a bit more conventional memory.  Run Manifest by typing MFT 
  at the DOS prompt. When Manifest displays, type H to select 
  Hints, and read the suggestions Manifest offers.

  If you do not use any programs that require DPMI (DOS Protected
  Mode Interface) memory, you can free up 1-2K by deleting the
  QDPMI.SYS device driver line from your CONFIG.SYS file.  
                    ÿþçBooting without QEMM
  
  If you want to boot your PC without QEMM's memory management, 
  first reset your system. Use the  power switch if necessary.

  When you hear a beep, hold down the Alt key until the boot 
  sequence stops. If you are using QEMM's DOS-Up feature, you will 
  see a message asking if you want to unload the DOSDATA device 
  driver; press Esc to unload it, then ÿþèimmediatelyÿþæ press and
  hold down Alt again until you see: "QEMM: Press ESC to unload 
  QEMM or any other key to continue with QEMM."

  Press the Esc key. QEMM will not load, so programs will not load 
  into High RAM, but your system will be usable.

           ÿþçSwitching Between MS-DOS 6's Memory Manager and QEMM

  QEMM provides all the functionality of MS-DOS 6's memory 
  manager, and much more. If you are using MS-DOS 6 and you 
  have run its MemMaker memory utility, you can switch back to 
  QEMM by running QEMM's Optimize program (assuming you
  have already installed QEMM on your hard disk). To run 
  Optimize, type OPTIMIZE at the DOS prompt. 

  If you ever want to switch back to MS-DOS's memory manager,
  simply run MemMaker again. If you are using QEMM's DOS-Up 
  feature, be sure to run QSETUP and disable DOS-Up before you run 
  MemMaker.  
   ÿþçSwitching Between MS-DOS 6's Memory Manager and QEMM 
   (Continued)
 
  If you are using QEMM's Stealth D*Space feature and you decide to
  switch back to MS-DOS 6's memory manager, the ST-DSPC.SYS 
  driver will perform the same function as DOS's DBLSPACE.SYS /MOVE 
  or DRVSPACE.SYS /MOVE.  That is, it will allow DBLSPACE.BIN or
  DRVSPACE.BIN to be moved into upper memory.  You can replace
  ST-DSPC.SYS with DBLSPACE.SYS or DRVSPACE.SYS, but you 
  will suffer no ill effects if you do not.
