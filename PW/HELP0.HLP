 The PANELWARE Help System can be called at any time with ALT+F5
 or ALT+H. The help system is context sensitive, i.e., by calling 
 help, the help screen which refers to the operation which you are 
 currently working in appears. With the <PgUp> or <PgDn> keys you 
 can flip forewords or backwards through the help screens. If all 
 of the help text cannot be seen in a help screen, the Cursor 
 Up/Down keys can be used to scroll through to the end. 
 The help system can be exited at any time with the <ESC> key.

Your visualization project can be constructed with PANELWARE OPERATOR 
PANELS and without extra work involving the PLC. The modular hardware 
construction of PANELWARE enables a configuration to suit all of the
requirements that may arise in your application.

A panel project consists of the following elements:
  - Pictures
  - Connection Definitions
  - Text Groups
  - Key Assignments
  - Alarm System

Notes on How to Create a Project                                 <0011>

 All hardware data for the project must be defined first. When 
 this is done, the elements which are needed in the project (pictures,
 connections, key assignments, alarms, etc.) can be created.
 Lastly, the project is compiled. 
 After a successful compilation, the project can be loaded onto 
 the operator panel.

The picture is the base element of a panel project. Pictures consist
of text, lines, fields, keys and LED functions.
Text (messages), and lines make up the so-called mask. Fields are 
used for entering values and displaying values from the PLC.
The amounts of fields, keys and LED functions which can be used 
in a picture depends on the controller used.

Pictures are saved by using the "Save" or "Save as" functions and 
existing pictures can be loaded for editing. By using the "New" 
function from the "File" menu option, a new picture can be created.
# 200 ########## Picture Editing ########################

The display format selected for the project creation is shown on the
screen. Text and lines are displayed in the format which they are 
displayed in on the panel. Fields are replaced with place holders.

If a picture element is selected with the cursor keys, the name of 
the picture element (text, line or field)is displayed in the lower 
right-hand corner of the display and the picture element is marked.

The picture element can now be deleted <DEL> or moved around the 
picture with key combinations <CTRL> + <Cursor keys>.

Edit Picture - General Field Parameters - Tagname                <0230>

For the Tagname, a symbolic variable name is entered. Assigning
a PLC address for the Tagname is done in the connection editor.
Variable names can be up to a maximum of 10 characters long. 
A two character connection identification (ID) can be added and must
be separated from the variable name with a '/' character. If no ID
is entered the default ID '/dd' is used automatically.
E.g.:       PLC-address:    VARIABLE1/m1   -> ID= m1
	    PLC-address:    VARIABLE1      -> ID= dd

First the connection ID must be defined in order to enter the PLC 
address for the connection! (See Help Screen <0601>) For BRIT...
devices, the register address in the PLC memory must be given direct.
You can also connect recipe elements instead PLC addresses in which
you give the name of the recipe element and the recipe ID.

 the maximum value.
# 222 ########## Picture Editing choosing field class & type #########
Edit Picture - Field Parameters - Input Locking                  <0237>

Input fields can be locked. A locked input field behaves like an 
output field and no input is possible.

Tagname for locking value:
 The input field reads the address specified for the Tagname before
 an entry can be made.
 Depending on the value which is read and the locking condition, the
 decision is made as to whether the entry can be made or not. For an
 input field which is protected with a password, the address which is
 defined for the password value under "Input Password" is entered.
# 222 ########## Picture Editing choosing field class & type #########
Edit Picture - Field Parameters - Password protection for inputs <0238>

Input Locked if (Locking condition):
Locking Value = 0
 An entry is only possible if a value which is not equal to zero is
 read from the PLC. At zero the input remains locked. In this
 condition you can lock and enable inputs from the PLC program.
 The password level has no effect in this case.
Locking Value < Password Level
 If the value in the PLC is less than the password level, there is no 
 input possible. If the value is the same or larger, input is possible.
 This condition is used for password protected input fields.
Locking Value >= Password Level
 If the value in the PLC is the same as or larger than the password
 level, no entry is possible.
# 222 ########## Picture Editing choosing field class & type #########
Edit Picture - Field Parameters - Password protection for inputs <0239>

Password Level:
 For input fields which have password protection, the protection level 
 from which the input is enabled again is entered here.
# 222 ########## Picture Editing choosing field class & type #########
Edit Picture - Field Parameters - Password protection for inputs <0240>

The following must be done for password protected input fields:

- All input fields, which are to be protected are assigned with the 
  same Tagname (PLC address) for the password level.
- 'Input Password' also gets the same address as its destination 
		   Tagname
- Input fields are programmed with
  'Input Locked if Locking Value < Password Level'.
- For those fields, the desired password level is entered
# 223 ########## Picture Editing choosing field class & type #########
Edit Picture - Field Parameters - Up/Down Input                  <0241>

Up/Down inputs can be incremented/decremented by means of two 
function keys.
All numerical input fields with the exception of Input Floats can be
configured as Up/Down inputs.
Two function keys must be defined for every Up/Down input, with which
the value will be incremented or decremented.
While the key is pressed the value in the PLC changes as well.
The Tagname for Completion is overwritten when the key is released.

Please make sure that if you change the text in the default language,
you change the translation as well since PCS cannot determine if the
old translation is correct.

After text has been changed in the default language, the translation
is still provided in the last line of the text layer editor.

For text layers where you have not called the text layer editor, you
will receive a warning that there is no translation when compiling.

Empty strings are allowed as translations. If you have called the
text layer editor at least once, you will not get a warning, even if
the translation is only an empty string.

It is recommended that all translations are made at once, after the
project has been finished.

Text Layer Overview                                              <0950>

The text layers make it possible for the operators to switch the
dialog language online. All text layers for a project are listed in
the text layer overview.
PCS numbers the text layers automatically, but you can enter a
so called "No. Panel" for each text layer. The number given here is
used to control a text layer or to switch the dialog language. It
must be at the PLC address for language switching.

Everywhere in PCS where you can enter text, you can get into the
text layer editor with F8 and enter the translation for all text
layers. see help screen <0900>.

Text Layer No.:
 The number is assigned automatically by PCS.

Text Layer Name:
 Here you can give the text layer a name. Mostly, the name of the
 language is entered here (German, English).

Panel Text Layer No.:
 Here you have to give the number with which the text layer will be
 activated. All text layers that are compiled must have a different
 number. The PLC program or the corresponding key command has to write
 this number to the PLC address for language switching in order to
 activate the text layer.

Compile Text Layer:
 The text layers will only be compiled with project if you answer YES
 here. The number of text layers that can be compiled is only limited
 by the size of the application memory in the panel. You can create
 projects with as many text layers as you like and only compile the
 ones that you need.
 The max. number of text layers is 64.
# ##### Importing Text Layers #####################
General Information Concerning Text Layer Import                 <0970>

Text Layer Import
 Text layer import is called from the text layer overview.
 Import is started by pressing <CTRL>+<I> or with menu item <File> /
 <Import>.
 When importing, all translated text (seperated from the default
 language with a TAB) is read and used in the respective PCS element
 (e.g. picture, alarm test,...). Default text is not used when
 importing a picture.
 If the default text in the project matches the default text in the
 translation file, the translation is read from the file and
 overwrites the available translatioon text. If the translation
 text is longer than the default text, the translation text is cut
 short.
# ##### Importieren von Textebenen #####################
General Information Concerning Text Layer Import                 <0971>

Message page for Text Layer Import
 When importing a text layer, a message page is created (similar to
 when importing variable assignmet tables) where the following points
 can be entered:
 - A picture, report, ... are imported completely, that means the
   default text are the same in the project and in the text file.
 - A picture, report, ... are not imported completely, that means
   there is text in the file or in the project that has no
   translation.
# ##### Importieren von Textebenen #####################
General Information Concerning Text Layer Import                 <0972>
 
 - A picture, report, ... was not imported, that means there is a
   picture in the file that doesn't exist.
 - A picture, report, ... was not found in the file.
 - Invalid description. When importing, a line that was found which
   starts with # but does not contain a valid description is shown
   on the message line. All lines up to the next valid description
   are ignored.
# ##### Exportieren von Textebenen #####################
General Information Concerning Text Layer Export                 <0980>

Text layer export is called from the text layer overview and
exports all pictures, reports, alarm text etc. from the selected
text layer. The default language can not be exported (is exported
automatically with all other text layers).

In order to be able to export a text layer, the desired text layer
must be selected with the cursor key. Export is started by pressing
<CTRL>+<E> or with menu item <File> / <Export>. You have to enter a
file name. This file is saved with the extension *.TXT.

Your PANELWARE Software User's Manual contains information about
the structure opf the exported text file.

General Information about the Alarm System                       <1000>

The Alarm System
Alarms are represented as alarm bits in the PLC. The alarm bits
must be in a contiguous bit field in the PLC.
The panel reads the alarm bit field from the PLC at the installed
scan rate, enters the changes in the alarm list and creates a printout.

The alarms are separated into alarm groups. Each group has its own
alarm bit field, scan rate and priority. Up to a maximum of 252
alarm groups can be defined. The alarm groups 'System Alarms' and
'Group Alarms' always exist automatically.
# 600 ######### Mask Alarm System Basic Configuration ###########

The alarms are entered into the CURRENT ALARM LIST. This list contains
all active alarms and alarms that have been reset without acknowledge.
The conditions for an alarm to be removed from this list, can be set 
with parameters.

With each alarm bit change, either to enter or remove an alarm from 
the current alarm list, an entry is made in the ALARM HISTORY LIST.
This list forms the basis for the printout on the alarm printer.

The recipe system groups PLC data sets into data files.
The data is saved in the panel and can be transferred from there to
the PLC.

The recipe structure (items that makes up the recipe) and the number
of data files (how many data files are saved in the panel for the
structure) are defined when the project is being set up with PCS.
# 700 #### zu keiner Maske zugeordnet #################################
Recipe System General Information - Continued                    <1301>

The panel controller provides 10 Kbytes of nonvolatile memory for
the recipe data. More information about backup possibilities for
recipe data can be found on help screens <1360>, <1370> and <1380>.

Recipes are organized similar to PLC connections. They have a recipe
ID and the names of the recipe items can be used in the same way as
PLC variables. Recipe values can be displayed on the panel if a recipe
item is connected to an output field or entered/displayed on the panel
if a recipe item is connected to an input field as the destination
tagname (e.g. item tagname/recipe ID) instead of a PLC variable.
# 700 #### zu keiner Maske zugeordnet #################################
Recipe System General Information - Continued                    <1302>

Each recipe has a predefined variable with the name INDEX. If the
data file number is written to this variable, the corresponding data
file is selected from the recipe. All of the references to recipe
items, as well as transfer functions, always use the data file that
is selected with the INDEX.
# 700 #### zu keiner Maske zugeordnet #################################

Transferring recipes in and out of the PLC is done with the tagname
for trigger. The PLC program or a corresponding key function can
write commands to the tagname for triggering. These commands cause
the transfer to be made. The panel expects a WORD UNSIGNED as the
recipe tagname. The following commands are allowed:

Command Code Description
0x0001       Download the selected data file
	     Write the data file selected with the INDEX to the PLC.
# 700 #### zu keiner Maske zugeordnet #################################

	     The data file no. 'nn' is written to the PLC.
	     This command works independent from the INDEX. With this
	     command, the PLC program can determine which data file
	     is to be loaded into the PLC.
	     (Please note that it is not possible to set the INDEX
	     from the PLC.)

Recipe Initialization                                            <1350>

You can set an initialization value for each recipe item in all data
files. This value is written to the panel as the current recipe value
when a project is transferred if:
-  there is not a recipe already in the panel, or
-  the parameter "Recipe Values for Download" in the "Config" menu
   "Channel 2" is set to "Overwrite recipes with initial Values".

You can only carry out this function if you have your PC connected
to the panel. PCS reads the recipe data from the panel and displays
a list of the recipes on the screen.

With the cursor keys, you can select one of the recipes from the list
and make a backup with the F1 key. If you haven't defined a file
name, the recipe name will be used as the file name.

If a project is loaded, the project path will be suggested as the
current path. If a project isn't loaded, the user path for PCS will
be suggested. However, you can select another path with F3 and also
define a file name.
# 700 #### Maske Rezept Restore #######################################
Recipe Restore                                                   <1370>

You can only carry out this function if you have you PC connected
to the panel.

First you have to select a recipe backup file (.REC). PCS compares
the recipe saved in the backup file with the one in the panel. If the
recipe names match, the backup file is identified as being valid. You
can carry out the backup. If the backup file and the recipe ion the
panel have different recipe items, only the ones with matching names
will be restored.

Recipe Backup Copy                                               <1380>

The panel can create a backup copy of the recipe data in the Flash
application memory. A backup copy should be made after changes are
made to the recipe data since the recipe data stored in non-volatile
RAM will be lost if the battery fails.
If the panel determines that the data is incorrect (incorrect
checksum), then it resets the recipe data with the help of the last
backup copy. In order to inform the operator of this, the error screen
is displayed immediately after booting and the variable ERR_NR or
ERR_CODE contains the value 6.

Recipe Backup Copy - Continued                                   <1383>

After the backup copy is created, R_SIZE is set to zero. This signals
that the backup copy is current. If recipe data is changed, then
R_SIZE is also changed and shows the amount of memory the next backup
copy requires.

A recipe backup made with the PC erases all of the old backup copies
and only keeps the newest. This creates space for more backup copies.
# 700 ######### Mask Project Download ########
Project Download                                                 <1400>

Interface:
 The PANELWARE CONFIGURATION SOFTWARE loads the project and (if
 necessary) the operating system through channel #2 to the modular 
 PANELWARE panel controller.
 You can select whether the COM1 or COM2 interface of your PC should 
 be used for this channel.
Set Clock:
 You can define whether the Real-time Clock on the panel controller
 should be synchronized with the clock of your PC during the project 
 download.
Baud Rate for System Download (at present, only with the C200):
 Before downloading the operating system to the panel controller, the
 transfer rate must be defined. The maximum baudrate depends on the 
 PC. If the operating system cannot be sent with the set baudrate,
 try using one lower. The panel controller adapts to the set baudrate
 automatically.
Transferring Recipe Values
 Here you can set how PCS should react if it determines that, when
 transferring a project, recipe values that are valid for the target
 device are present. These values can either be kept or written over
 with the values of the recipe initialization.
# 726 ######## Mask Printer Settings  ########

 project.
 
 If you choose "YES" the compiler creates a DOS text file called
 <PROJECT_NAME.PRT> in the current project directory. This file can be
 edited or printed with any text editor.
 
 The format of the .PRT file corresponds to the parameters as set in
 "Printer Settings".

Compile Slave Projects:
 If you choose NO for this option the compiler compiles the Main
 Project and the current Slave Project. If the Main Project is loaded
 as the current project, none of the Slave Projects will be compiled.
 
 The name of the current Main and Slave Project is displayed
 in the middle of the top line of your PCS screen.
 
 If you choose YES for this option, all the Slave Projects will be
 compiled.
