    How to Write a Help File - Introduction

    You can create your own help files and include them in PG 2000. They can
    be accessed under the <HELP><ADDITIONS> menu option. The customized help
    screens can be used to describe your own function block libraries, tasks
    libraries or anything that you may find useful.

    To write your customized help file, there is some important information
    that you need to know.

    @010[ Concepts ]: Shows you the major parts of the help screens and their
                      meaning.

    @200[ The File ]: What the section and entries in the actual help file
                      should be.

    @100[ Special  ]: Special characters and there use, e.g. Command Buttons.

  A "Help Screen" looks like this:

                       ÉÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ»

  You can change the title, text body and command buttons on each help screen.
  The fixed instructions appear on each screen and cannot be altered or
  removed. The colors are also set by PG2000 and cannot be changed at the
  moment.

                                                                   @001[  Overview  ]

     Help Screen Concepts - Elements of the Help Screen

    The TITLE       - is a single line of text that can be up to 80 characters
                      long.
                    - is usually used as a chapter or section heading.
                    - cannon contain command buttons (they have no effect).


    The TEXT BODY   - consists of 21 lines x 80 characters.
                    - is the actual text of the help screen.
                    - can contain COMMAND BUTTONS within it.


    The COMMAND     - refer to other related topics.
        BUTTONS     - are the method of moving between different help screens.
                    - can be in any where in the text body.
                    - buttons have a special @110[ Syntax ].




                                                                   @001[  Overview  ]
.100
    Special Characters

    There are some special characters that have a command meaning. These
    characters affect the help file processor. When these characters appear in
    the text file they perform a function based on the characters immediately
    following them.
    The special characters are:

        %%  @@

    The @@ character is used for @110[ Command Buttons ].

    The %% character is used as a delimiter in the @210[ File Header ].
                                                         
    If you want the character to actually appear on the screen you must put
    two directly next to each other, e.g. %%%%





                                                                   @001[  Overview  ]
.110
    Command Buttons Syntax

    A COMMAND BUTTON has the following format:

                 ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÂÄÄÄÄÄÄ Angle brackets enclose the button text
            @@NNN [ Topic ] -> appears on screen ->@110 [ Topic ] (no function)
            ³ ³ ³    ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ Button text
            ³ ³ ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ Can be spaces between the number and brackets
            ³ ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ Number of the help screen connected to this
            ³                    button (.NNN in the @220[ File Body ]).
            ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ Special character for a button (No spaces
                                 allowed between the @@ and the number).

    The number is the help screen number jumped to when this button is
    selected. If there is no help screen corresponding to the number NNN then
    help is exited.

    There must be no spaces between the @@ and the number. Spaces are however
    allowed between the number and the bracket.

    Command Buttons - Hints and Recommmendations

    1.  The main command buttons should appear on the last line of the text
        body.

    2.  Buttons should stay in very similar positions on the bottom line.

    3.  There should always be a button to return to the first or overview
        screen. This button should ALWAYS be in the same place on the screen.

    4.  The initially highlighted button is the one closest to the upper left
        corner of the screen (Upper has preference).

    5.  Only the characters inside the brackets are displayed on the screen so
        the other characters can be subtracted from the line length.






                                                                   @001[  Overview  ]

    The File - Major Components

    The help file is an ASCII file that can be created with any text editor.
    You are allowed to include the entire displayable ASCII character set
    (0 to 255).

    The help file consists of 3 main parts:

          1.@210[ The Header ]: The screen the help file starts on
          2.@220[  The Body  ]: The individual help screens
          3.@230[  The End   ]: The file terminator

    The sections of the file must be in the above order.

    The file should be in the ONLINE.HLP\ directory. It can be called any 
    valid DOS file name. To easily identify help files, it is recommended
    that they are given a ".HLP" extension.




  @240[ Example ]                                                        @001[  Overview  ]

    File Sections - The Header
                                                                  @220 [  File Body  ]
    The HEADER must be the first section in the file.
    Example:
                ÉÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ Text Editor ÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ
    Comment   ->º$ Help File for New Functions 21/03/94 Karl Addams
    Defines   ÚÄº%%%%
    the first ´ º1,0:1
    screen    ÀÄº%%%%
                º

    Comment lines are only allowed before the first set of two percent signs.

    The percent signs are used as delimiters for the numerical subsection.

    "1,0:1" defines the first screen to be shown when the help is called. In
    this case, it would be help screen number 1. The number following the
    colon (:) must be changed if a different help screen is to be shown at the
    start, e.g. 1,0:20 for screen 20.


                                                                   @001[  Overview  ]
.220
    File Sections - The Body
                                                                   @221 [  More ...  ]
    The body may consist of many help screens. The sequence of the screens in
    the file is not important because you control the movement between the
    screens.

    Each help screen begins with a ".NNN". NNN is the index number of the help
    screen. This is used with the@110[ Command Buttons ]for moving between
    help screens. The number must be on the first line on its own. It is not
    shown on the screen.

    The second line is the TITLE.

    The next 21 lines are the BODY of the help text.

    After the 21 lines of body text, a new help screen can be started with
    another ".number". Please ensure that the number of lines is correct. This
    is easy as most text editors display 23 lines at a time. That means the
    help screen can be seen entirely, from the line containing the index number
    to the last line of the text body.

                                                                   @001[  Overview  ]
.221
    File Sections - The Body - Hints and Recommendations
                                                                   @230 [  File End  ]
    1.  The help screen numbers don't have to be consecutive or in any definite
        order.

    2.  Related topics should be kept together. Starting these blocks of topics
        on base numbers makes it easier to find your way around.

        e.g.    0    -   99   Introduction
                100  -  199   Bob's Functions
                200  -  299   Simon's Designs
                1000 - 2000   Other Stuff

    3.  Leave blank numbers so that more help screens can be added in between
        existing help screens if necessary.

    4.  When counting the width of the line do not forget to subtract the
        special characters used in the @110[ Command Buttons ].








                                                                   @001[  Overview  ]

    File Sections - The End
                                                                    @240 [  Example  ]
    The file must have an end marker. The end marker has a similar format to
    the number entries for the help screen. After the last help screen, the
    entry:

                .End

    must be in the first column of the next line.

    Adding the Help File to the ADDITIONS List

    The file name and short description must be added to a special file called
    HLP-XXX.LST in the PG2000\PG2000.EXE directory. The XXX is the country code
    number. This is the same number as is used in the main help file and menu
    file. If the corresponding country file cannot be found the file
    HLP-049.LST is used (German).

    This *.LST file can be edited with any text editor. Each entry in
    the file is a line. The entries appear in the menu in the same order as in
    the file. The entries have the following format:

        filename.ext    ;Menu text

    The "filename.ext" is the name of your custom help file, e.g. MYHELP.HLP,
    and should be in the PG2000\PG2000.EXE directory. The "Menu text" is the
    entry that appears in the list in PG2000 after selecting HELP->ADDITIONS. The
    menu text entry can be up to 29 characters long. You can have any number
    of extra help files.


                                                                   @001[  Overview  ]
