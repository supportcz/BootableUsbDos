    PROFILING MODE: B&R OBJECTS, PCC TASKS and HS TASKS

    Runtime Measurement Procedure:

    1. Establish connection to the PCC (function <Options><Connection>)
    2. Select the desired profiling mode for the runtime measurement
       (@122[B&R Objects], @130[PCC Tasks] or @140[HS Tasks])
    3. Initialize the runtime measurement (function <Profile><Init>)
    4. Start the runtime measurement (function <Profile><Start>)
    5. Evaluate the measured profiling data (function <Profile><Display>
       or <Profile><cyclic>)
    6. Stop the runtime measurement (function <Profile><Stop>)
    7. Save the profiling data (function <File><Save>)

    To guarantee consistent data, measurement is automatically stopped for
    the evaluation period, and then restarted (also valid for cyclic
    evaluation).

    To avoid @121[Cycle Time Violations] during measurement, cycle time monitoring
    for standard task classes is automatically deactivated during the
    measurement period.
                                                                        @001[Overview]

    PROFILING MODE: B&R OBJECTS, PCC TASKS and HS TASKS (continue)

    Cycle Time Violations During Measurement:
    Since the system is loaded with the task classes and system tasks, as well
    as the activities of the profiler runtime module during runtime
    measurement (profiling overhead), standard task class cycle time
    monitoring is automatically deactivated during the measurement period. This
    means that if the standard task class cycle time monitoring was activated
    with the ZYKVL_enable() function, all individual cycle time violations
    for standard task classes are ignored during the measurement period. If
    however a maximum cycle time violation (standard task classes) or a 
    high-speed task class cycle time violation occurs, measurement is
    automatically stopped. The appropriate error message is given during
    evaluation of the interrupted measurement. However, the data measured
    up to when the cycle time violation occurred still count.

    In severe cases, runtime measurement is not possible for heavily loaded
    systems!

    "#Activate" column:
    In this column is shown how often the task class or system task was 
    activated during measurement.

    "Max. Time" column:
    Maximum net runtime for activating the task class or system task during
    measurement (given in ๆsec.). In determining the net runtime, interruption
    time of the task class (or system task) by higher priority tasks or 
    interrupts is not included.

    during measurement (given in ๆsec.). In determining the net runtime,
    interruption time of the task class (or system task) by higher
    priority tasks or interrupts is not included.

    "Min. Time" column:
    Minimum net runtime for activating a task class or system task class
    during measurement (given in ๆsec.). In determining the net runtime,
    interruption time of the task class (or system task) by higher
    priority tasks or interrupts is not included.

    "Max.Ticks" column:
    Maximum total runtime for activating a task class or system task class
    (given in ticks; 1 tick = 1 system cycle = 10 msec.). The total runtime
    is determined from the net runtime plus the time taken when higher
    priority tasks or interrupts interrupt the task class (or system task).

    "%%" column:
    In addition to the runtime data, the system capacity (percentage) for the
    respective task class (or system task) is displayed in the outer right-hand
    column.



                                                                        @001[Overview]

    Profiling Overhead:
    Since the activities of the profiler, as well as the task classes and system
    tasks use system time (processor time) during runtime measurement, the 
    percentage system capacity for the profiler runtime module is given in the
    line "Profiling Overhead".

    System Idle Time
    Since profiling overhead is only required during measurement, the absolute
    idle time in the system (system idle time) is calculated from the idle time
    during runtime measurement (IDLE) and the profiling overhead.
    The absolute idle time in the system is displayed as a percentage of the
    total system idle time in the "System Idle Time" line.

    Application Idle Time:
    The idle time for the application (application idle time) is
    calculated from the system idle time and the total runtime of those tasks
    which have lower priority than the cyclic user tasks:

    Application Idle Time = System Idle Time + Idle Time for applications

    The idle time for the application is given as a percentage of the total
    system time in the line "Application Idle Time".

    Procedure for Measuring Stack Capacity:

    1. Establish connection to the PCC (function <Options><Connection>).
    2. Select the @151[Stack Capacity] profiling mode. When this has been carried
       out, the measured profiling data is automatically displayed.
    3. Save the profiling data (function <File><Save>).

    You can calculate the stack capacity of all task classes and system tasks
    of a controller using the profiler. By calculating the stack requirements
    for individual task classes (stack capacity), you obtain a fair idea of
    what to define for the configuration of stack sizes with the PCC
    configurator or the PG2000 programming system.

    "Supervisor Stack Configured" column:
    The size of the configured user stack for the corresponding task class
    or system task is displayed in this column (in bytes and decimal form).

    "Supervisor Stack Free" column:
    The size of the configured user stack for the corresponding task class
    or system task is displayed in this column (in bytes and decimal form).
    The size of the supervisor stack for standard, high-speed, interrupt and
    exception task classes depends on the system interrupt load and from the
    stack requirement of the functions which are called in the tasks of this
    task class.
    By determining the supervisor stack requirement for individual task classes,
    you obtain a good idea of what to define for the configuration of the stack
    size with the PCC configurator.

    In the dialog box which is called by selecting the <Connection> function,
    you can define the status of the connection between the programming device
    and the PCC:

    After the PG2000 software package has been installed, the Help
    program profiler has to be adjusted to the existing system
    configuration of your PC.
    This adjustment must be carried out before the profiler is started, using
    a text editor (e.g. MS DOS editor) in the ASCII file PROFILER.INI
    (in directory C:\PG2000\PROFILER).

    The ASCII file PROFILER.INI can consist of several sections. Every section
    contains a different system configuration. The start of a new section
    is characterized by a section name in square brackets. To use the
    system configuration set in the [<Section Name>] section, you must state
    the appropriate section name when starting the profiler.
    When installing the PG2000 software package, sections [default], [com1],
    [com2] and [mono] are automatically created.

    GENERAL INFORMATION

    The profiler is a utility program for measuring, evaluating and displaying
    important system data like task runtimes, system- and stack capacity etc.

    @120[Runtime Measurement] provides you with information about the capacity of
    your system and about the runtime behavior of individual tasks
    (task classes). This information makes it easier to select the right task
    classes and therefore supports system capacity optimization.
    By @150[Determining the Stack Requirement] of individual task classes (stack
    capacity), you get a good idea of the stack sizes required in the
    configuration.
