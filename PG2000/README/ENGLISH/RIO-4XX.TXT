Attention!
==========
¯ Because of an error in the RIO-ISL Firmware V4.0, when using RIO V4.1
  or higher also all ISL-Stations must be updated to V4.1! An RIO-ISL
  V4.0 can only be operated with RIO Version V4.0 on the Master.

¯ RIO-ISL V4.1 is compatable with all RIO versions

¯ When using the RIO_list FBKs or RIO-Spoolers, no slave module info
  is allolowed to be requested in the help program since this can
  disrupt the execution of the FBK.
 
¯ Either the module
       rio_lib.br (with RIO FBKs)
  or
       riotrap.br (without RIO FBKs)
  is to be used.

¯ The module bugfix.br (V1.14 or higher) and exermo.br must be burned
  on the controller!
  
Remote I/O V4.00
================
¯ An error in the Slave Firmware when an output module was corrected.

¯ RIO_init FBK
   Durinig ISL operation, the slave address set on the ISL module can
   be read with the RIO_init FBK (see DOCU).
¯ Improved error messages

¯ When a RIO Exception occurs, the error is now properly entered
  corerctly in the error module and can be read with PG.
  The Info Parameter has the following meaning:
     $MMSSTTCC
               MM Master Slot Number
               SS Slave Number
               TT Slave Typ ($10=2005,$11=2010,$12=ISL2005,$13=ISL2010)
               CC Slave Error counter

¯ An error that occurred if there is an overload of tasks (IO from
  other tasks were no longer updated) was corrected.

Remote I/O V4.20
================
¯ When setting the MAX Station Parameters to the value < 32, it was
  possible that an error iccurred when configuring the Slave.
  Starting with V4.2, the MAX Station Parameter can be set as desired.

¯ An additional FBK was added "RIO_list" that allow the module
  configuration of a Slave to be read.

¯ Spooling via RIO is now possible.

Remote I/O V4.21
================
¯ RIOTRAP, RIOLIB now also work together with Bugfix >= V1.20
  (error up to and incliuding V4.2: use of Master numbers >= 2 in PG
  causes an error)

¯ Error in the RIO FBKs V4.20 for ISL operation was corrected (Compiler
  error Microtec V4.3)

Remote I/O V4.30
================
¯ Overload error was corrected: The output on the Slave fell short

¯ CP200 Supports (VBR) => RIOSST/EXC OK

¯ Control in Service Mode was removed (DL im Service now possible)

Remote I/O V4.40
================
¯ Limiting: Up to 8 duplications of shovel instruction are created
  by the PLC SW if many tasks use the same RIO variables. The previous
  limit of 64 instructions has been extended to 256 instructions.

Remote I/O V4.50
================
¯ Output bits within a byte can now be used in various task classes
  without being overwritten.

¯ RIO Slave 2003 is supported

¯ Downloading in Service Mode can sometimes cause the download to come
  to a stand still;

¯ Faulty input data was sometimes given for task classes with input
  variables without Init-SP.

¯ If the RIO_in or RIO_out FBK returns an error, the RIO configuration
  no longer declares further RIO_in or RIO_out calls as invalid.
  Therefore, calls can be made again in the next cycle.

¯ Slave IO error messages are now only given for the block affected
  (no longer globally for all blocks)
