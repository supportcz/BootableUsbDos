
Project Update V1.25 => V2.0
=============================



    When converting projects that were created and used with PG2000 V1.25,
    the following things are to be taken into account:


1. Directory Structure

    The directory structure has changed with the installation of project
    management in PG2000. Basically, there is are directories in the form
    <Projectname>.pgp. Under this directory is the databank dirctory (dbk)
    and the source directory (pgm). The first step in the coonversion is
    creating the directories. This is done either with "rename", "move" (if
    supported by the operating system) or "xcopy". The directories used in
    V1.25 can be taken from the file user.pri in the V1.25 "EXE" directory.

        E.g.:
                >md project1.pgp
                >xcopy c:\pg2000\pg2000.dbk project1.pgp\dbk\ /s /v /e
                >xcopy c:\pg2000\pg2000.pgm project1.pgp\pgm\ /s /v /e


2. Databank - Update

    Since the databank structure has slightly changed, it is necessary to
    build particular information to accomodate for the new data bank
    functions. To do this, the index files (*.idx) of all directories of this
    project are to be deleted. This is done with "xdel" (DRDOS), "golbal del"
    (4DOS) or with "del in all subdirectories of the databank (MSDOS).

        >cd project1.pgp\dbk
4DOS    >global delete *.idx     or
DRDOS   >xdel *.idx /S           or
MSDOS   >del *.idx
        >cd  <Name>.sps          } for all directories of the form <Name>.SPS
        >del *.idx               }

    When the converted project is started for the first time, the message:
    "Rebuild of the databank necessary" will appear once. All necessary
    changes for the databank update are automatically performed.


3. Source File Update

    To convert the source files, a conversion of the file format is
    necessary. The tool DC5.EXE is supplied to do this. Please make the
    conversion of existing FNK sources singly. If this is forgotten, it is
    possible to convert the source files to FBK files at a later date. To do
    this on the file extension has to be changed from ".src" to ".fub".

        >cd project1.pgp\pgm
        >dc5 /cfub <FBKname>.bur  } for all exsiting FBK sources
        >dc5 /csrc *.bur
        >dc5 /csrc *.awl
        >dc5 /csrc *.kop


4. Converting the Initialization File

    From version V2.0 on, the initialization data for PG2000 is saved in the
    file PG.INI. To convert the file USER.PRI, the tool PRI2INI should be
    used.


5. Adding Prepared Projects into PG2000 V2.0

    If all above mentioned preparations are made, PG2000 can be started.
    From the project menu of PG2000, the converted projects can be added with
    the function "Search". The serach path is to be entered (e.g. c:).


6. Special notes for Converting Projects with Intelligent Perilperals (IP)

    From V2.0 on, the handling of IPs parallel to the main CPU of the PLC is
    operationally possible directly from the GDM. For this a structural
    adjustment in the databank is nesessary. For this reason, the following
    procedure is necessary when converting projects with IPs:

        1. Open the variable declaration on the IP symbol (<Alt-O> <V>).
        2. Export the declaration (<Alt D> <X> <Editor->XPE>)
        3. If the IP is already in the correct position in the GDM, go to 4.
            -   Place the IP in the GDM
            -   Copy the GDM entries from the IP directory
            -   goto 5
        4. Open the IP layer, enter the module number and cycle time .
        5. Open the variable declaration for the IP.
        6. Import the exported Var.Decl. files from step 1.
        7. If a "-.pvs" file with the variable declaration exists for the IP,
           import this too (<Alt-D> <I> <ASCII ->Editor>).


7.  First Time Editing of a Converted Project

    After the project conversion, at the first "Project -> Generation", the
    compiled option "Parser" should be set,since otherwise  there could be a
    time related problem with the compilation of tasks with FBKS. For
    projects with IPs, it would be sensible to perform the
    "Re-init->Generate->Purge" cycle.
