     Setting the FIXRAM in boot up, if a module stored in FIXRAM is corrupted.

It has been possible to store modules in FIXRAM since PCCSW version V1.1.
These modules are installed after a COLD RESTART, like modules in the EPROM.
However there modules can also be dynamically manipulated using the
DA functions in the B&R library.

If, in a case of error, a module stored in FIXRAM should be corrupted, e.g.
by unintentional overwriting without checksum adaption, or the battery
backup fails, error 6402 (B&R module checksum is incorrect) or 3017
(checksum of the B&R module is not right) are entered in the error module
at boot up (PCCSW V1.10). The CPU then goes into SERVICE mode. With every
boot up after this, except in DIAGNOSE mode, the error is re-registered and
the PCC always goes into SERVICE mode. The PCC can only be restarted by
booting up in DIAGNOSE mode using PG2000 and erasing the FIXRAM.

In this case, the FIXSETUP.BR module enables you to automatically reboot
up with a COLD RESTART, without PG2000. The FIXRAM is deleted, the
application is started again. Only the entry in the error log book shows
that the error occurred.

Attention: The FIXSETUP.BR module must be burned so that it is active. A
           download without burning is not enough. As the module deletes the
           FIXRAM if an error occurs, it cannot be stored in FIXRAM
           or it would delete itself and cause a fatal error !
           The FIXRAM is only supported from PCCSW V1.10 onwards, so
           this module has no function in V1.05 !



 Here is the detailed sequence description of FIXSETUP :

 - At every boot up, a check for defective modules is made in the FIXRAM.

 - If a module with an incorrect checksum is found, the error 6434 (COLD
   RESTART, because FIXRAM is defective), is entered in the error log book
   by FIXSETUP. The info in the error log book corresponds to the address
   of the defective module.
   Errors 6402 or 3017 are entered as well, i.e. when using FIXSETUP, error
   6434 is also entered !

 - The FIXRAM is completely erased, i.e. all modules in the FIXRAM are lost.
   Nothing else is possible due to memory management reasons !!!

 - Then, a COLD RESTART is triggered. Then the PCC boots up, all modules
   are reinstalled, the error no longer occurs and the application is
   started. The DA functions determine that the modules in FIXRAM no
   longer exist; they must be re-created by the application, and put
   in FIXRAM again !
