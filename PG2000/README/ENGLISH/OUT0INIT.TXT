                       OUT0INIT.BR

     Initialization of the Outputs with Zero at Boot Up



 Date       :      6. June 1994
 Version    :      V1.10
 Author     :      Bernhard Hochstrasser


The system task out0init.br initializes all battery backed outputs with the
value 0 (Zero) at boot up, before the Init-SPs of the PLC tasks are called. In
this way, all outputs are initialized to zero, even after an INIT boot up.
However, you can set the outputs to any value in the Init-SP of a PLC task.

 The requirement for the initialization of the outputs is that6 the system
 module out0ini.br must be fixed or burned !

ATTENTION : The system task out0init.br initializes the outputs only in PLCSW
            V1.10 !
            In PLCSW V1.05 the outputs are NOT initialized !
