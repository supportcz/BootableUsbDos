Expansions and Corrections in V2.24

Export and Import
=================
¯ The entire export/import functionality was updated and the procedure
  for exporting and importing objects (tasks, FBKs, data types, ...)
  was unified and is now managed in a clearer manner.

¯ If the entry "EXPORT_PATH=<path>" is in the PG.INI file, then
  the entry <PATH> is used as default suggestion during export in
  the field for the export path entry.

¯ If the entry "IMPORT_PATH=<path>" is in the PG.INI file, then
  this path is checked for ASCII files (task and FBK sources).

¯ Constants can be exported in ASCII format.

¯ Init values for variables in ASCII format are supported.

¯ The comparison for newer ASCII files is not only made for task
  sources, it is also made for FBK sources.

¯ For PVs that have long names with the maximum possible length, it
  was possible that they were not recognized as being the same and
  the box with the question "Overwrite, Keep, ...." was opened.

¯ When importing faulty RIO variables, error 322 is now given.

¯ After project import and then using the Make instruction, a
  significant rise in the memory requirements for pcc_global PVs
  could occur.

¯ Global PVs can now also be exported and imported in ASCII format
  on a PP.

¯ If possible, the processor links for PVs remain in tact during PV
  import.

¯ During ASCII export for a project with many LAD tasks, errors
  7003 or 6000 could occur.

¯ Changes of data types which occur during  data type import are
  not taken into consideration for the Make instruction.

¯ When importing constants, it was possible that the value of the
  constants are always overwritten.

GDM
===
¯ FBK list handling was implemented analog to the object lists.
  With the GDM (Editor - Pop Up "FBK Lists"), a FBK list can be
  created and all FBKs entered can be compiled.
  All FBKs with source code available will be entered in the list
  (*.FUB). Compiling the FBKs is carried out with the Make command.

¯ Because of changes in the handling of the PPs in the GDM,
  error "Missing System Bus Components" occurred if an XP152 was
  used and was accessed when converting projects that were created
  with version V2.22 into V2.23.

¯ Single line comments in the GDM could no longer be changed completely
  at times.

¯ The entry for shifting symbols in the GDM was disabled.

¯ In certain circumstances, offsets could be overlapped for linked
  PVs (CPU <-> IP).

¯ The limitations when assigning module addresses for PPs / MPs
  (maximum address 8) were lifted.

¯ When checking the GDM, large projects can cause PG to crash.

¯ Checking the GDM can be interrupted with <ESC>.

¯ Compiling via FBK lists can be interrupted with <ESC>.

¯ When optimizing a PCC symbol with several processors, it is possible
  that the offsets for shared variables (linked or pcc_global)
  were no longer correct.

¯ The names for the task class symbols in the GDM were changed from
  TC#1 - TC#4, HS#1 - HS#4 to TC#1 - TC#4, HS#1 - HS#4.

Code Generation
===============
¯ Assignments to constants are not always rejected with an error
  message.

¯ When using the setting "optimized bit handling" the statement
  bit_var XOR bit_var (bit_var with type BIT) is not compiled
  correctly.

¯ When rebuilding tasks, the length for alias PVs were always
  recreated with 0.

¯ In individual error situations when compiling tasks, the memory
  for the stacks was no longer freed.

¯ More sensible error message given if the Rebuild Info exceeds 64k.
  Data Bank

¯ The poorly informative message "Data type no. > no < not available in
  the in data bank" was replaced by "Data type for (ALIAS-)PV >
  pvname < with type no. (no) not available in the data bank".

¯ When attempting to delete a library in a project which has no
  library, a crash occurred with CSCAPE error.

¯ When changing the scope of a PV in the VD, the other parameters
  for the PV are no longer deleted.

¯ When printing the VD, the column for the Init Value for the PV
  was dimensioned too wide.

¯ For  projects with many data types, it was possible that the type
  declaration for the wrong data type was opened in the data type
  column of the VD when entering 'T'.
  Ladder Diagram

¯ LADs created with a PG version <= 2.23, are always compiled when
  the editor was opened and closed (without making changes).

¯ When inserting an empty line in the first line of a LAD, is was
  possible that improper cross connections  were made.

¯ When rebuilding LAD tasks, data types were not rebuilt which
  are used in the Init SP.

¯ When entering comments with three lines in LAD, PG could crash if
  the three lines have the same length.

¯ After cutting or deleting a marked area in the LAD editor, various
  errors can occur (contacts are no longer assigned, visible contacts
  are no longer recognized  -> open lines, the names of contacts were
  no longer shown correctly, ...).

Data Modules
============
¯ Data modules are now only compiled with Make when changes are made
  as with tasks.

¯ The display of the module parameters from the data Module editor is
  now possible.

¯ Saving on the PCC from the data module editor is now possible.

¯ Compiling data modules can done via compiler settings.

PV Monitor
==========
¯ The complete IEC String for I/O variables can now be shown in the
  PV Monitor.

¯ When exiting the PV Monitor, PG could crash.

¯ The values for constants were sometime shown incorrectly in the PV
  Monitor.

¯ The precision of the display of FLOAT PVs in the PV Monitor was
  increased.

Other
=====
¯ In the dialog boxes which are opened after calling "Create Project",
  "Copy Project" and "Search Project", a path browser to select a
  directory can be called by pressing a button.

¯ In the display for the error module, the program counter is given as
  LONG.

¯ The selection of the operating system during OS Download didn't
  function properly (the first found was always loaded).

¯ If a *.INI file does not exist when PG is started, one is created.

¯ When entering a path with more than 30 characters with the file
  selection box, an CSCAPE error occurred.


Extensions and Corrections in V2.25

Ladder Diagram
==============
¯ Because of an error in LAD in PG versions < V2.24, it was necessary to
  build in correction into V2.24.  The corrections take effect when the  LAD
  file is loaded into the editor. For big LAD files, this procedure could
  take several minutes. In V2.24, this procedure was takes place each time
  the file is opened. Opening the file in V2.25 and saving it solves this
  problem.

PL 2000
=======
¯ PL2000 now supports character constants such as 'x'.

¯ PL2000 now supports ASSERT as a new syntax element:

        Syntax : ASSERT(<logical expression>)

  When the logical expression becomes 0, the ASSERT element stops the PCC.
  (service mode).

¯ When using a large number of lines in PL2000, it was possible that error
  message 7021 was given with an invalid text message. V2.25 solves this
  problem.

Constants
=========
¯ When assigning a value to a constant, it was possible that no error
  message was given.

¯ Symbolic constants can now also be used within ACTION statements.

Communication
=============
¯ With certain notebooks (e.g. : Compaq Contura), the system could
  crash while online communication was in progress. V2.25 solves this
  problem.

Extensions and Corrections in V2.26

Communication
=============
¯ The entire procedure for sending messages has been updated concerning
  communication between the PC and PCC :
  * In the bottom right the foot line, the state of the connection and
	also information concerning the PCC  will be shown (communication
	partner, interfaces, PCCSW version, state of the PCC).
  * For services that take longer (download, ...), the percent finished
	is also shown in the foot line.
  * Error status of the connection are either prevented or a meaningful
	message is given.
  * The messages concerning system problems (write protection on EPROM,
	missing system expansions, ...) was updated, to make error analysis
	easier.
  * Success or failure messages are set up as unit and include add.
	information.
  * messages without meaning or messages that have no meaning for the
	user have been done away with.

¯ Deleting the databank information when optimizing an object can
  be blocked by the user.

¯ The local memory requirements (analog and digital) for a task will be
  output in the module parameter box. Since the actual memory requirements
  are only available after the taskbuilder procedure (order of the offset
  entry, alignment), the display is only valid after the conversion.

Error Correction
================
¯ If the number of B&R modules set was smaller than the number required,
  an error message that has no meaning for the user was given.

¯ Error messages that make no sense, which could occur during module
  download have been replaced by messages which give an exact reason
  for the cause of the error.

¯ If the DL was interrupted with ESC, it was possible that the wrong
  text was shown in the message window.

¯ If the connection was broken when selecting a task for the PV monitor,
  a red message window appeared with the error numbers 4012 or 4252.

¯ In the PV Monitor, it was possible that an incorrect value was shown
  for structures which consist of several byte arrays.

¯ When forcing values using the PV Monitor and then entering a global
  "FORCE OFF", the status remained "f" in the PV Monitor.

¯ When closing PG with ALT-F4 during an INIT-SP for a task, PG could
  crash.

¯ During spooler DL in the PCC, the error message "Service State Conflict"
  could be given if a version of the spooler was already available.

¯ When linking analog contacts in LAD by pressing the F6 key, incorrect
  lines could be shown.

¯ When creating an then removing a processor layer, it was possible that
  the processor layer was still shown in the project path.

¯ When attempting to store a module in FIX RAM if not enough memory was
  available, an error text was given which had little meaning.

¯ Synchronize in the GDM with an XP152 was not possible.

¯ If error analysis was interrupted during communication, it was possible
  that PG could crash.

¯ Modules with a $ character in the name were not found in the GDM for
  a DL.

¯ After a TOTAL INIT on the CP200, the error messages "Overflow on
  Connection" or "ALI:ERROR 2" could occur, even though connection was
  active.

¯ If a PV was declared as a structure which was larger than 65535 bytes
  (e.g. 260 x 256 bytes), no error message was given.

¯ When attempting to burn a module on a controller which has the APM set
  to WRITE PROTECT, an incorrect error message was given.

¯ When attempting to delete the FLASH on a controller which has the APM
  set to WRITE PROTECT, an incorrect error message was given.

¯ Only the first character of the library name was considered significant
  for the libraries in the project.

¯ If the SEARCH function was called in LAD, no default entry was given in
  the menu item Symbol.

¯ It was possible that comments in LAD were not completely visible.

¯ It was possible that constants in LAD were not recognized as such
  and therefore had a incorrect value.

¯ The input for the offset in the offset editor was limited to 3 positions.

¯ For X or T versions of the PCCSW earlier than 1.10 (e.g.: X0.53), it was
  not possible to configure FIXRAM.

¯ When using PCC global FBK alias, an error in code generation can cause
  the FBK output to be written incorrectly is some cases.

¯ The error message give when attempting to burn a module to a write
  protected APM was incorrect (only for PCCSW V1.xx).

¯ The error message given when attempting to write a module in a FIX-RAM
  that is not configured was incorrect (only for PCCSW V1.xx).

¯ When calling FBK/Functions within FBKs, was is possible that incorrect
  code could be created for the FBK in some cases.

¯ When using pcc global variables on MPs/PPs, the incorrect message
  "CPU PV not allowed to be changed" was given during the declaration
  of these variables on the MP side. If an offset was given for the PV
  in the offset editor on the CPU side, then it was not possible to use
  the PV on the MP side.
