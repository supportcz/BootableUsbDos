    B&R Libraries V1.10 for the C-Toolbox                   5. May 1994
    *******************************************************************

    In the CBX directory, you will find the header files for the libraries
    (Prototyping, Defines, ...) as well as the Microtec-Libraries. These
    libraries can also be used with the C-Toolbox (FBKs or idle time tasks).

    BURTRAP : Functions of the module "burtrap.br"

        For the C-Toolbox, 2 MCC libraries includig their respective header
        file burtrap.h are supplied. One library for the PLCSW V1.05 and one
        for the PLCSW V1.10. On the extent of the function has changed. It
        was constructed for V1.10 and also a few functions were removed in
        the meantime due to replacement functions (PIO_*, TI_*).
        The interface to the functions available in V1.05 has not changed, so

        Note: When calling the function ERR_warning(), the interface has not
              changed, but the function behind it has be extended. In V1.10,
              the label USER-WARNING will also be added into the error log
              book.
              If the function in the MCC library version V1.05 of BURTRAP.LIB
              is called in PLCSW V1.10 (BURTRAP.BR), this information is
              missing or it is accedentally entered in the log book, because
              it is not defined. This is indicated only with the display in
              PG2000 (wrong error type)

        For this, the files for V1.10 are in the CBX directory (burtrap.lib,
        burtrap.h). The files for V1.05 are also included in the subdirectory
        LIBRARY.105\CBX.

    MATHTRAP : Functions of the module "mathtrap.br"

        This library was constructed for V1.10 and is now avaulabel in the
        C-Toolbox. This is why there is only one version of the MCC library
        and header file.
        The library can alos be used with the PLC SW V1.05 since there are no
        version dependent parts.
