The following is a list of hints on how to improve the memory utilization on
a PC during a PG2000 session.

Recommendations for the Installation and Operation of PG2000:

1	Hardware
    1.1 CPU: Use an AT, at least a '286 however it is much better with a '386
             or '486.
    1.2 NDP: A maths co-processor is not required and does not affect program
             execution if it is available.
    1.3 Memory: Equip your computer with as much RAM as possible. A minimum
                 of 4 MB is recommended.
    1.4 A hard disk is definitely required.
    1.5 Serial interfaces are optional. Two should be available: one for the
        mouse and the other for communication with the PLC. They must be
        correctly configured as COM1: and COM2:.
    1.6 Profi: A profiBus card in the PC is optional.

2	Setup
    2.1 Shadow: Setup your BIOS to use shadow RAM for video and BIOS EPROM.
    2.2 Cache: The memory area of a ProfiBus card must be set to a
               non-cacheable region.

3	Operating System
	The following operating systems can be used:
    3.1 DRDOS Version 6.0 or above (Novell/Digital Research)
    3.2 MSDOS Version 5 or above (Microsoft)
    3.3 MSDOS Version 3.3 (Microsoft)

4	CONFIG.SYS
    The settings in CONFIG.SYS have the greatest affect on the speed and
    memory availability for application programs. It is worth spending some
    time setting up this file because PG2000 works better with the memory
    that can be made available.
    4.1 Memory Management
        In order to fully use the main memory, you can install a memory
        manager, if the operating doesn't already have one.
        4.1.1 QEMM Version 5.12 or above (Quarterdeck)
              The corresponding line in CONFIG.SYS should look as follows:
                  DEVICE=QEMM386.SYS RAM VREMS FRAME=C800
              if using DRDOS then directly following this line is:
                  DEVICE=HIDOS.SYS /BDOS=FFFF
                  HIDOS=ON
              if using MS-DOS then directly following this line is:
                  DOS=HIGH
              Load as many drivers as possible in upper memory with
              LOADHI.SYS.
        4.1.2 MAX386 Version 5.10 or above (Qualitas)
              The corresponding line in CONFIG.SYS should look as follows:
                  DEVICE=386MAX.SYS EMS=2048
                  HIDOS=ON or DOS=HIGH
              Load as many drivers as possible in upper memory with
              386LOAD.SYS.
        4.1.3 EMM386.SYS (included with DRDOS)
              The corresponding line in CONFIG.SYS should look as follows:
                  DEVICE=EMM386.SYS /B=FFFF /I=D800-F000 /R=NONE /V /F=C800
                  HIDOS=ON
              Load as many drivers as possible in upper memory with HIDEVICE.
        4.1.4 EMM386.EXE (included with MSDOS or Windows)
              The corresponding line in CONFIG.SYS should look as follows:
                  DEVICE=HIMEM.SYS
                  DEVICE=EMM386.EXE 2048 RAM FRAME=C800
                  DOS=HIGH,UMB
              Load as many drivers as possible in upper memory with
              DEVICEHIGH.

    4.2 Parameters
        4.2.1 FILES: At least...
                     FILES=40
                     A value of up to 60 is meaningful and useful for PG2000.
        4.2.2 STACKS: Should be...
                      STACKS=0,0
                      so the serial communications to the PLC are not
                      disrupted and to prevent the operating system message
                      "Internal Stack Memory overflow".
        4.2.3 BUFFERS: Set this according to the recommendation of your disk
                       cache program or to
                       BUFFERS=20 for MSDOS or
                       HIBUFFERS=20 for DRDOS.
        4.2.4 COUNTRY: Set the country code according to the language that
                       you want the menus and messages to appear in, e.g.:
                       COUNTRY=001,,COUNTRY.SYS
                       Do not install switchable code pages of it is
                       avoidable, because you need the memory!
    4.3 Drivers
        Only install driver programs that you really need ! ANSI.SYS is not
        required for PG2000.
        Move as many drivers as possible into upper memory.
        Example:
            DEVICEHIGH=MOUSE.SYS
        Many operating systems allow the keyboard driver to be loaded as a
        device driver in CONFIG.SYS. In this case the load on main memory is
        much less (DRDOS).
        Example:
            HIINSTALL=KEYB.COM GR+ /MH
        4.3.1 RAM Disk: If using program with access to extended/expanded
                        memory, it makes no sense to use a RAM disk.
        4.3.2 Networks: If you must install a network driver, only use what
                        is absolutely necessary for work station operation.
                        Do not install things like EMAIL, MESSAGE, CHAT,
                        REMOTE etc.
                        Please ensure that the network server supports file
                        locking if the databanks or projects are stored on a
                        shared disk.
        4.3.3 Stacker, DoubleStor, AddStor and Consorten
                  Since occasional problems with these disk compression
                  programs during the operation of PG were reported, it is
                  recommended that they are not used.
                  Also if PG2000 is operated of a non-compressed partition,
                  there is also the problem of the resident parts of the
                  driver in working memory.
                  A few of these programs also need quite a lot of space for
                  their data buffer. This means that PG2000 must work in a
                  restricted amount of memory.
                  Load the compression driver before the EMM386 driver in
                  case there is not enough memory afterwards.

5	AUTOEXEC.BAT
	The settings in AUTOEXEC.BAT load all required memory resident programs and set environment variables used in application programs.
    5.1 Keyboard: Try to load the keyboard driver in upper memory.
    5.2 Mouse: Try to load the mouse driver in upper memory.
    5.3 Disk-Cache: A disk cache program can accelerate the compilation of a
                    PLC program up to 600%. It is recommended that a disk
                    cache program is installed. However the memory buffer
                    should not be set to large, 512 KB is enough. If more
                    than 4 MB of memory is available, more can be reserved
                    for cache. After installing the cache there should be at
                    least 2 MB, preferably 3 MB XMS or EMS memory available.
                    Try to load the cache program in upper memory.
                    A few examples (incomplete):
        5.3.1 PC-Cache is a part of PCTOOLS (Central Point Software) and
              works with all versions.
        5.3.2 SuperPck, version 4.04 (Multisoft) and later is included with
              DRDOS.
        5.3.3 SmartDrive (Microsoft) is included with MD-DOS and Windows.
              Version 4.0 and all later versions are suitable!
    5.4 Tools that have to be memory resident take up memory that could be
        used by PG2000. Programs such that show the time, pop-up calculator
        or "Sidekick".
        When they are called, a few of these programs try to store the
        interrupted program to disk so that the TSR has enough memory. During
        active communication between PC and PLC, this usually causes the PC
        to crash!
        If in doubt do not load these tools.
