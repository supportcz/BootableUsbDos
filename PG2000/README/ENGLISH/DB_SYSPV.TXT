New System Variables SPSSW V1.10 (DB_SYSPV.INP) :
==============================================

The new system variables have been extended in SPSSW version 1.10. No the
following system variables are available in INIT-SPs (!!!):

    _TOTAL_INIT    BIT   Flag, if a TOTAL INIT was executed last cycle
                         (previously _URINIT)
    _INIT          BIT   Flag, if an INIT was executed last cycle
    _DOWNLOAD      BIT   Flag, if this task was downloaded last cycle
    _DEBUG         BIT   Flag, if this task is be debugged
                         (ATTENTION : Offset was changed, therefore the task
                         for V1.05 to be used in V1.10, must be recompiled
                         after the new system variables have been added to the
                         database.)

    _TC_TIME       WORD  Cycle time of the TC/HSTC in units of 100 microsecs
                         max. 6.5 Sec. cycle time possible
                         ATTENTION : in V1.05 was in milli secs.
                         (previously _T_ZYKLUS)
    _TC_No         BYTE  Task class number 1 to  4 for TC 1-4,
                                          -1 to -4 for HSTC 1-4
                                          -8 for EXCTC
                                          -9 for IRQTC
                         (previously _TKNR)
    _TC_TSK_No     BYTE  Number of PLC tasks in the current TC or
                         HSTC/EXCTC/IRQTC
                         (previously _N_SPSTASK)


In cyclic operation, the following system variables can be requested:

    _PIO_OLD       BIT   Flag, if the old input will be used in the task class
                         (1 cycle old, corresponding to V1.05):
                             0 = new (updated) input,
                             1 = old input
                         (ATTENTION: only valid in TC, not in HSTC)
    _DEBUG         BIT   Flag, if this task is being debugged

In V1.05, the sytem variables were not correctly supported in the HS task
classes. In V1.10, the system variables can be read even in an INIT-SP,
independent on the task class.

The system variable _FORCE is NO longer supported (!!!) in V1.10, because it
could only be checked in cyclic operation. This was because the TC#1 data area
for all HS task classes, but no clear differentiation was made.There is a new
B&R library FBK "FORCE(tc_no)" to check if a TC or HSTC is being forced.

Note :      The system variables can also be added to the existing database
            with "DBTOOL.EXE". To do this you have to copy the file
            "DB_SYSPV.INP" into the ROOT directory of the correcsponding
            database and the call the DBTOOL - PLC->Variables.
